## 8. Project Structure, Files, and Environment

### Q31. What is the purpose of the `app/` directory in this project? (2/10)

**A:** The `app/` directory contains all the main source code for the FastAPI application, including the API endpoints (`main.py`), database models (`models.py`), database connection setup (`database.py`), data validation schemas (`schemas.py`), and CRUD logic (`crud.py`). This separation keeps the code organized and maintainable.

### Q32. What is the role of `main.py`? (2/10)

**A:** `main.py` is the entry point for the FastAPI application. It defines the API endpoints, initializes the app, and connects the endpoints to the database and business logic.

### Q33. What does `models.py` contain? (2/10)

**A:** `models.py` defines the SQLAlchemy ORM models, which map Python classes to database tables. In this project, it defines the `Employee` table structure.

### Q34. What is the purpose of `schemas.py`? (2/10)

**A:** `schemas.py` contains Pydantic models used for data validation and serialization/deserialization of request and response bodies in the API.

### Q35. What does `crud.py` do? (2/10)

**A:** `crud.py` contains the functions for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on the database, abstracting the database logic from the API endpoints.

### Q36. What is the function of `database.py`? (2/10)

**A:** `database.py` sets up the SQLAlchemy engine, session, and base class for ORM models, and manages the connection to the SQLite database.

### Q37. What is the `venv/` directory? (1/10)

**A:** `venv/` is a virtual environment directory that contains a self-contained Python environment with its own installed packages, ensuring project dependencies are isolated from the system Python.

### Q38. What is a `requirements.txt` file and how is it used? (2/10)

**A:** `requirements.txt` lists all the Python packages required for the project. You can install all dependencies with `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

### Q39. What is the purpose of `.gitignore`? (2/10)

**A:** `.gitignore` specifies files and directories that should not be tracked by Git, such as `venv/`, `__pycache__/`, `.DS_Store`, and database files like `employees.db`. This keeps the repository clean and avoids committing unnecessary or sensitive files.

### Q40. What is `employees.db`? (1/10)

**A:** `employees.db` is the SQLite database file where all employee records are stored. It is created and managed by SQLAlchemy when the FastAPI app runs.

### Q41. Why is there an `__pycache__/` directory? (1/10)

**A:** `__pycache__/` stores compiled Python bytecode files (`.pyc`), which help Python run modules faster. It is automatically generated and should be ignored in version control.

### Q42. What is the purpose of `README.md`, `aboutproject.md`, and `project_steps.md`? (2/10)

**A:**

- `README.md`: Provides an overview, setup instructions, and project structure.
- `aboutproject.md`: Gives a detailed explanation of the project, objectives, tech stack, and procedures.
- `project_steps.md`: Offers a step-by-step guide for building and running the project.

### Q43. Why is it important to keep documentation files up to date? (2/10)

**A:** Up-to-date documentation ensures that users and collaborators can understand, set up, and contribute to the project efficiently, reducing confusion and errors.

### Q44. What is the use of auto-generated documentation (Swagger UI and ReDoc) in this project? (2/10)

**A:** They provide interactive, always up-to-date API documentation based on the code, making it easy to test endpoints and understand request/response formats.

### Q45. How would you add new features or endpoints to this project? (3/10)

**A:**

- Define new Pydantic models in `schemas.py` if needed
- Add new ORM models in `models.py` for new tables
- Implement CRUD logic in `crud.py`
- Add new endpoints in `main.py`
- Update documentation files accordingly

### Q46. How do you back up or migrate the SQLite database? (3/10)

**A:**

- Back up by copying the `employees.db` file
- For migration to another DB (e.g., PostgreSQL), use tools like SQLAlchemy's migration libraries (Alembic) or export/import data

### Q47. What are the best practices for structuring a Python web project? (4/10)

**A:**

- Separate code into logical modules (API, models, schemas, database, CRUD)
- Use virtual environments
- Keep configuration and secrets out of source code
- Write clear documentation
- Use `.gitignore` to avoid committing unnecessary files

### Q1. What is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS)? (2/10)

**A:** An RDBMS is a software system that manages relational databases, where data is stored in tables with rows and columns. It supports SQL for querying and ensures data integrity, relationships, and ACID properties (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability).

### Q2. Explain CRUD operations with examples. (2/10)

**A:** CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, Delete. These are the four basic operations for managing data:

- **Create:** `INSERT INTO employees (name, age, department) VALUES ('Alice', 28, 'HR');`
- **Read:** `SELECT * FROM employees;`
- **Update:** `UPDATE employees SET age = 29 WHERE name = 'Alice';`
- **Delete:** `DELETE FROM employees WHERE name = 'Alice';`

### Q3. What are JOIN operations? Give an example. (3/10)

**A:** JOINs combine rows from two or more tables based on a related column. Example:

```sql
SELECT employees.name, departments.dept_name
FROM employees
JOIN departments ON employees.department_id = departments.id;
```

### Q4. What is a Primary Key and a Foreign Key? (2/10)

**A:**

- **Primary Key:** A unique identifier for each record in a table (e.g., `id` in `employees`).
- **Foreign Key:** A field in one table that refers to the primary key in another table, establishing a relationship.

### Q5. What are aggregate functions? (3/10)

**A:** Aggregate functions perform calculations on multiple rows, e.g., `SUM()`, `AVG()`, `COUNT()`, `MAX()`, `MIN()`.

### Q6. Explain CTEs and Window Functions with examples. (5/10)

**A:**

- **CTE (Common Table Expression):** Temporary result set for complex queries.
  ```sql
  WITH dept_count AS (
    SELECT department, COUNT(*) as num_employees FROM employees GROUP BY department
  )
  SELECT * FROM dept_count;
  ```
- **Window Function:** Performs calculations across a set of rows related to the current row.
  ```sql
  SELECT name, department, AVG(age) OVER (PARTITION BY department) as avg_age FROM employees;
  ```

## 2. Database Modeling & Python

### Q7. What is database normalization? Why is it important? (4/10)

**A:** Normalization is the process of organizing data to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing tables and defining relationships to ensure each piece of data is stored only once.

### Q8. What is an ORM? How does SQLAlchemy help in Python projects? (4/10)

**A:** ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) allows developers to interact with the database using Python objects instead of SQL queries. SQLAlchemy is a popular ORM in Python, enabling model definition, query building, and database migrations in a Pythonic way.

### Q9. How do you connect Python to a SQLite database? (3/10)

**A:** Using the `sqlite3` module or an ORM like SQLAlchemy. With SQLAlchemy, you define the connection string, create an engine, and use sessions to interact with the database.

### Q10. What is a Pydantic model and why is it used in FastAPI? (3/10)

**A:** Pydantic models are Python classes used for data validation and serialization. In FastAPI, they ensure incoming request data matches the expected schema and types, providing automatic error messages for invalid data.

## 3. REST API & FastAPI

### Q11. What is a REST API? List its key principles. (2/10)

**A:** A REST API is a web service that uses HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) to allow communication between systems. Key principles: statelessness, resource-based URLs, use of standard HTTP methods, and structured responses (usually JSON).

### Q12. How do you define an endpoint in FastAPI? (2/10)

**A:** By using decorators like `@app.get()`, `@app.post()`, etc., above Python functions. Example:

```python
@app.get("/employees")
def read_employees():
    ...
```

### Q13. How does FastAPI handle data validation and error handling? (4/10)

**A:** FastAPI uses Pydantic models for validation. If data is invalid, FastAPI automatically returns a 422 error with details. Custom error handling is done using `HTTPException`.

### Q14. What is automatic API documentation in FastAPI? (2/10)

**A:** FastAPI auto-generates interactive API docs (Swagger UI and ReDoc) at `/docs` and `/redoc` based on your code and Pydantic models.

### Q15. How do you implement CRUD operations in FastAPI? (3/10)

**A:** By defining endpoints for each operation and connecting them to database logic (using SQLAlchemy and Pydantic models for validation).

---

## 4. Data Validation, Error Handling & Security

### Q16. How do you validate input data in FastAPI? (3/10)

**A:** By defining request schemas with Pydantic models. FastAPI checks incoming data against these models and returns errors for missing or invalid fields.

### Q17. How do you handle errors and return status codes in FastAPI? (3/10)

**A:** Use `HTTPException` to return custom status codes and error messages. FastAPI also returns 422 for validation errors automatically.

### Q18. What are best practices for API security? (5/10)

**A:**

- Use authentication (API keys, OAuth2, JWT)
- Validate all input data
- Use HTTPS
- Limit request rates (rate limiting)
- Handle errors without exposing sensitive info

---

## 5. Testing, Documentation & Deployment

### Q19. How do you test API endpoints with Postman? (2/10)

**A:** By sending HTTP requests to your API endpoints, specifying method, URL, headers, and body. You can check responses, status codes, and automate tests in Postman.

### Q20. What is the purpose of Swagger UI and ReDoc? (2/10)

**A:** They provide interactive, auto-generated documentation for your API, allowing you to test endpoints and view schemas directly in the browser.

### Q21. How do you deploy a FastAPI app to production? (6/10)

**A:**

- Containerize with Docker
- Use a production ASGI server (e.g., Gunicorn with Uvicorn workers)
- Deploy to cloud platforms (Heroku, AWS, Azure)
- Set environment variables and configure the database for production

### Q22. What are the benefits of using a virtual environment? (2/10)

**A:** It isolates project dependencies, preventing conflicts between packages and ensuring reproducibility across environments.
