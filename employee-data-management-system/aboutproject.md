# About the Employee Data Management System Project

## Project Description
The Employee Data Management System is a comprehensive REST API solution designed to manage employee records efficiently. Built using FastAPI, it provides robust CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, integrates with a SQLite database, and ensures high standards of data validation and error handling. This project is the culmination of the Data Engineering Internship, synthesizing skills in SQL, Python, API development, and data quality.

## Objectives
- Develop a RESTful API for employee data management
- Implement CRUD operations with proper validation
- Integrate with SQLite using SQLAlchemy ORM
- Ensure error handling and return appropriate HTTP status codes
- Provide auto-generated API documentation

## Technology Stack & Tools
### Programming Language
- **Python (>=3.8):** Main language for API and database logic

### Frameworks & Libraries
- **FastAPI:** Modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs
- **Uvicorn:** ASGI server for running FastAPI applications
- **SQLAlchemy:** ORM for database modeling and interaction
- **Pydantic:** Data validation and settings management using Python type annotations
- **SQLite:** Lightweight, file-based relational database

### Development Tools
- **Virtual Environment:** Isolate project dependencies (`venv`)
- **pip:** Python package installer
- **Postman:** API testing tool for endpoint validation
- **Swagger UI & ReDoc:** Auto-generated API documentation (built-in with FastAPI)
- **Git:** Version control for source code management

## Software Requirements
- **Python (>=3.8):** Download from [python.org](https://www.python.org/downloads/)
- **pip:** Included with Python installation
- **Virtual Environment:**
  - Create: `python -m venv venv`
  - Activate: `source venv/bin/activate` (macOS/Linux) or `venv\Scripts\activate` (Windows)
- **FastAPI, Uvicorn, SQLAlchemy, Pydantic:**
  - Install: `pip install fastapi uvicorn sqlalchemy pydantic`
- **SQLite:**
  - Pre-installed on most systems; can be managed via Python's `sqlite3` module
- **Postman:** Download from [postman.com](https://www.postman.com/downloads/)
- **Git:** Download from [git-scm.com](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Step-by-Step Procedure
1. **Set Up Environment**
   - Install Python and pip
   - Create and activate a virtual environment
   - Install required packages using pip
2. **Initialize Project Structure**
   - Create project directory and subfolders (`app/` for source code)
   - Add `README.md` and `aboutproject.md` for documentation
3. **Database Design**
   - Define employee schema: `id`, `name`, `age`, `department`
   - Use SQLAlchemy to model and create tables in SQLite
4. **API Development**
   - Set up FastAPI app in `main.py`
   - Implement endpoints:
     - `POST /employees`: Add new employee
     - `GET /employees`: List all employees
     - `GET /employees/{id}`: Get employee by ID
     - `PUT /employees/{id}`: Update employee
     - `DELETE /employees/{id}`: Delete employee
   - Use Pydantic models for request/response validation
5. **Validation & Error Handling**
   - Validate input data (types, required fields)
   - Handle errors (invalid IDs, missing data, DB issues)
   - Return appropriate HTTP status codes (201, 404, etc.)
6. **Testing**
   - Use Postman to test all endpoints
   - Validate responses and error handling
   - Run server locally with Uvicorn
7. **Documentation**
   - Access auto-generated docs at `/docs` (Swagger UI) and `/redoc` (ReDoc)
   - Update `README.md` and `aboutproject.md` with setup and usage instructions
8. **(Optional) Deployment**
   - Containerize with Docker for cloud deployment
   - Deploy to platforms like Heroku, AWS, or Azure
   - Configure SQLite for production use

## Learning Outcomes
- Mastery of REST API development with FastAPI
- Practical experience with database integration and ORM
- Understanding of data validation, error handling, and API documentation
- Exposure to modern development tools and deployment practices
