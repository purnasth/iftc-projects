## 1. What is a database model? (Difficulty: 2/10)

**Answer:**
A database model is a conceptual framework that defines how data is structured, stored, and accessed in a database system. It determines the organization of data, relationships between data entities, and rules for data integrity. Common models include relational (tables, rows, columns) and NoSQL (document, key-value, graph, etc.).

---

## 2. Explain the difference between relational and NoSQL databases. (Difficulty: 3/10)

**Answer:**
Relational databases use structured tables with predefined schemas and support complex queries using SQL. They enforce data integrity through relationships and normalization. NoSQL databases are more flexible, handling unstructured or semi-structured data, and include types like document stores (MongoDB), key-value stores (Redis), and graph databases (Neo4j). NoSQL is better for scalability and rapid development, while relational is preferred for transactional consistency.

**Tip:** Explore NoSQL databases and compare their use cases with relational databases.

---

## 3. What is normalization in database design? Why is it important? (Difficulty: 3/10)

**Answer:**
Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and improve data integrity. It involves dividing tables into smaller, related tables and defining relationships. This ensures efficient storage, prevents anomalies, and makes updates easier.

---

## 4. Describe the purpose of the file structure in this project. (Difficulty: 2/10)

**Answer:**
The file structure organizes code and data for clarity and maintainability:

- `data/`: Stores the CSV dataset.
- `src/`: Contains Python scripts for ETL and visualization.
- `output/`: Saves generated charts.
- `requirements.txt`: Lists dependencies.
- `README.md`: Documentation.
  This separation helps manage tasks, makes collaboration easier, and supports reproducibility.

---

## 5. What is ETL? How is it implemented in this project? (Difficulty: 4/10)

**Answer:**
ETL stands for Extract, Transform, Load. In this project:

- **Extract:** Load CSV data using Pandas.
- **Transform:** Clean data (handle missing values, correct types), derive new columns (e.g., month, year).
- **Load:** Prepare data for analysis and visualization.
  The ETL process is implemented in `src/etl.py`.

---

## 6. How do you read a CSV file in Python? (Difficulty: 2/10)

**Answer:**
You can use Pandas:

```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('data/Amazon Sale Report.csv')
```

This loads the CSV into a DataFrame for analysis.

---

## 7. What are the key columns in the e-commerce sales dataset, and why are they important? (Difficulty: 3/10)

**Answer:**
Key columns include:

- `Order ID`: Unique identifier for each order.
- `Date`: For time-based analysis.
- `Category`: For product grouping.
- `Status`, `Sales Channel`, `SKU`, etc.: For filtering and deeper analysis.
  These columns enable aggregation, trend analysis, and category-wise insights.

---

## 8. How do you handle missing or incorrect data in Python? (Difficulty: 3/10)

**Answer:**
Use Pandas functions like `dropna()` to remove missing rows, or `fillna()` to replace missing values. Data types can be corrected using `pd.to_datetime()` for dates and `pd.to_numeric()` for numbers. Always inspect data before analysis.

---

## 9. How do you create new columns or metrics from existing data? (Difficulty: 4/10)

**Answer:**
You can derive new columns using Pandas. For example, extracting month and year from a date:

```python
df['Month'] = df['Date'].dt.month
df['Year'] = df['Date'].dt.year
```

Or calculating total sales if quantity and price are available:

```python
df['Total Sales'] = df['Quantity Ordered'] * df['Price Each']
```

---

## 10. How do you aggregate data to compute metrics like total sales per month or order count per category? (Difficulty: 4/10)

**Answer:**
Use Pandas `groupby()`:

```python
monthly_orders = df.groupby(['Year', 'Month'])['Order ID'].count()
category_orders = df.groupby('Category')['Order ID'].count()
```

This summarizes data for trend and category analysis.

---

## 11. How do you visualize data in Python? (Difficulty: 3/10)

**Answer:**
Use libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn. For example:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import seaborn as sns
sns.lineplot(data=monthly_orders)
plt.show()
```

Visualizations help identify trends and patterns.

**Tip:** Explore advanced libraries like Plotly for interactive charts.

---

## 12. What is Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and why is it useful in Python? (Difficulty: 4/10)

**Answer:**
OOP is a programming paradigm based on objects and classes. It helps organize code, promote reuse, and model real-world entities. In Python, OOP is used for building scalable, maintainable systems. Concepts include classes, inheritance, encapsulation, and polymorphism.

---

## 13. What are Python decorators and how are they used? (Difficulty: 5/10)

**Answer:**
Decorators are functions that modify the behavior of other functions or methods. They are used for logging, access control, timing, and more. Example:

```python
def my_decorator(func):
    def wrapper():
        print('Before')
        func()
        print('After')
    return wrapper
```

---

## 14. How do you connect Python to a database? (Difficulty: 5/10)

**Answer:**
Use database drivers like `sqlite3`, `psycopg2` (PostgreSQL), or `mysql-connector-python`. Example:

```python
import sqlite3
conn = sqlite3.connect('example.db')
```

ORM libraries like SQLAlchemy simplify database interactions.

**Tip:** Learn about ORM for more advanced database programming.

---

## 15. What is the purpose of the requirements.txt file? (Difficulty: 2/10)

**Answer:**
`requirements.txt` lists all Python packages needed for the project. It allows easy installation of dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

---

## 16. How do you document a data project? (Difficulty: 3/10)

**Answer:**
Use a README file to describe the project, dataset, setup instructions, analysis steps, and insights. Good documentation helps others understand and reproduce your work.

---

## 17. What are some best practices for organizing a data analysis project? (Difficulty: 4/10)

**Answer:**

- Use clear folder structure (data, src, output).
- Write modular code (separate ETL, visualization).
- Document everything.
- Use version control (Git).
- Test code and validate results.

---

## 18. How can cloud services be used in data engineering? (Difficulty: 6/10)

**Answer:**
Cloud platforms like AWS, Azure, and Google Cloud offer scalable storage, processing, and analytics tools. You can store large datasets, run ETL jobs, and deploy machine learning models. They support distributed computing and easy collaboration.

**Tip:** Explore cloud services for advanced data engineering tasks.

---

## 19. What is an ORM and why is it useful? (Difficulty: 5/10)

**Answer:**
An Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) library like SQLAlchemy allows you to interact with databases using Python objects instead of SQL queries. It simplifies database operations, improves code readability, and helps manage schema changes.

---

## 20. What are some advanced data visualization techniques? (Difficulty: 6/10)

**Answer:**
Advanced techniques include interactive dashboards (Plotly, Dash), geospatial visualizations, and custom chart types. These help communicate complex insights and engage users.

**Tip:** Practice with Plotly and Dash for interactive visualizations.

---

## 21. How do you ensure data integrity and consistency in a database? (Difficulty: 5/10)

**Answer:**
Use constraints (primary key, foreign key), normalization, and transactions. Regularly validate and clean data. Design schemas to prevent duplication and enforce relationships.

---

## 22. What is the role of Pandas in data engineering? (Difficulty: 3/10)

**Answer:**
Pandas is a Python library for data manipulation and analysis. It provides powerful tools for reading, cleaning, transforming, and aggregating data, making it essential for ETL and analytics tasks.

---

## 23. How do you handle large datasets efficiently in Python? (Difficulty: 6/10)

**Answer:**
Use chunking in Pandas (`read_csv(..., chunksize=...)`), Dask for parallel processing, or move data processing to cloud platforms. Optimize code and hardware resources.

---

## 24. What is the importance of version control in data projects? (Difficulty: 3/10)

**Answer:**
Version control (e.g., Git) tracks changes, supports collaboration, and enables rollback to previous states. It is essential for teamwork and reproducibility.

---

## 25. How do you validate the results of your analysis? (Difficulty: 4/10)

**Answer:**
Cross-check results with sample calculations, use assertions in code, visualize data for sanity checks, and compare with known benchmarks or business expectations.
