## Full Syllabus & Project Details

### Database Model

Database models are crucial in data engineering as they provide a structured framework for organizing, managing, and retrieving data efficiently. They define how data is stored, related, and accessed, which facilitates effective data manipulation and analysis. For instance, relational database models use tables to represent data and relationships, enabling complex queries and transactions. NoSQL models, like document or key-value stores, offer flexibility for handling unstructured or semi-structured data. Data engineers use these models to design schemas that optimize performance and ensure data integrity. They also employ these models to integrate data from various sources, build data pipelines, and support scalable storage solutions. By using well-defined database models, data engineers can create robust and efficient systems that handle large volumes of data, support analytics, and ensure data consistency and accessibility. Thus, database models are foundational in building and maintaining effective data engineering solutions.

### Python

Python is a versatile programming language widely used in data engineering for its simplicity and powerful libraries. It facilitates data manipulation, automation of data workflows, and the implementation of complex data processing tasks. Python libraries like Pandas, NumPy, and Dask support data transformation and analysis, while tools like Apache Airflow and Luigi help manage data pipelines. Its rich ecosystem enables seamless integration with databases, APIs, and cloud services, making Python a crucial tool for building and maintaining efficient data processing systems.

## Project

### E-Commerce Sales Data Analysis

**Objective:** Develop a Python-based system to analyze sales data from an e-commerce store. The project involves reading data from CSV files, performing data transformations, and generating visualizations to gain insights into sales performance.

#### Step-by-Step Instructions

1. **Data Acquisition:**
   - Obtain Dataset: Find and download an e-commerce sales dataset from a source like Kaggle.
   - Download Files: Ensure the dataset is in CSV format for easy processing.
2. **Data Extraction:**
   - Read Data: Use Python to load the CSV files into a data structure, such as a Pandas DataFrame.
3. **Data Transformation (ETL):**
   - Clean Data: Address any missing or incorrect data. This may involve filling in missing values or correcting data types.
   - Transform Data: Create new columns or derive new metrics from existing data. For example, calculate the total sales amount for each transaction or extract information from date fields.
4. **Data Aggregation:**
   - Aggregate Metrics: Summarize the data to compute key metrics. For instance, determine the total sales per month, average order value, or total sales per product category.
5. **Data Visualization:**
   - Generate Charts: Create visual representations of the data to help understand trends and patterns. This could include line charts to show sales trends over time or bar charts to compare sales across different product categories.
6. **Documentation:**
   - Document the Process: Write a detailed README file that includes a description of the dataset, the steps taken in data extraction and transformation, and instructions for running the Python scripts. Explain the insights gained from the visualizations.

#### Project Deliverables

1. Python Scripts: Scripts for reading data, performing ETL operations, and creating visualizations.
2. Visualizations: Charts and graphs that illustrate key findings from the data analysis.
3. Documentation: A README file explaining the dataset, the analysis process, and how to execute the code.

This project provides practical experience with Python for data manipulation and visualization, suitable for entry-level data engineers.
