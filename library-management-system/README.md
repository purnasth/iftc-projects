# Library Management System (SQL Project)

## Project Description

The Library Management System is a database-driven application designed to manage a library’s book inventory, patron records, and book lending activities. The system allows for efficient tracking of books, authors, patrons, and loan transactions. Key features include database creation, table relationships, data manipulation, automation through stored procedures and triggers, and reporting via SQL queries.

## Technology Identification

**Core Technology:**

- **Relational Database Management System (RDBMS):**
  - MySQL (recommended for this project)

**Tools You’ll Need:**

- MySQL Server (local or cloud)
- SQL Client: MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, or MySQL CLI
- (Optional) Scripting language (Python, Node.js, etc.) for automation
- (Optional) Git for version control

## How to Approach the Project

1. **Set Up the Database:**

   - Install MySQL.
   - Run the provided SQL script (`library_management.sql`) to create the database and tables.

2. **Design and Create Tables:**

   - Tables: `Books`, `Authors`, `Patrons`, `Loans` with specified columns and relationships.

3. **Insert Sample Data:**

   - Sample records for each table are included in the script.

4. **Write SQL Queries:**

   - Example queries for joins and aggregations are provided.

5. **Create Stored Procedures:**

   - A procedure to add a new book and update author details if needed is included.

6. **Implement Triggers:**
   - A trigger to update the `ReturnDate` in the `Loans` table when a book is returned is included.

## What Is This Project?

This is a classic database design and management project, often used to learn and demonstrate skills in:

- Database schema design
- Data manipulation with SQL
- Writing advanced SQL queries (joins, aggregations)
- Automating tasks with stored procedures and triggers

## SQL Script Overview

All SQL code for this project is in `library_management.sql`:

- **Database and Table Creation**
- **Sample Data Insertion**
- **Example Queries**
- **Stored Procedure**
- **Trigger**

## How to Use

1. Open your SQL client (MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, or CLI).
2. Copy and run the contents of `library_management.sql`.
3. Test the queries and procedures.
4. You can add more sample data or queries as needed.
